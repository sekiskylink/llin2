Operation Sub committee
=======================
1. What the system can produce an the anticipated risks raised.
How the system will take care of certain process
tracing of data from the village...
acutual = households and number of people there in
Check inflation by households or number of people in the households
aprox 230 subcounties in wave 1 -> 600 data entrants
3 data entrants per sub county (690 yet we have 600)
lowest wave has 18 districts
management of the tasks of the data entrants
- receipt of data from the sub county supervisors, allocation to entrants -> making sure that there is a check
- there has to be double entry, but for 6% (just to counter check)
    to ensure that the data is representative of the situation on the ground.
    people entering data will be more accurate knowing sb will double check the data.

    we can do another quality check on the 100% - say 4% of the entire data set
    ( re-register households,

- database will have to produce 2 reports required by AMF
    -> variance checks done by the 105%
        variance check for the quality of the data entry, error rate
    -> clear action on what has been done - corrective actions

    At the point variances are identified, we get a third person to make changes for what was  entered and then there should be a record that it was changed. Then the process rerun again if any issues.

    Indexing, the ability to know the village from which the paper is coming from and the VHT who captured it and the village - traceability.
    Hardcopy should have a document trail within the system.
    Components of registration forms pre-entered on the mtrac side.
        -> VHT texts in the serial number of the registration form. (Pick the Village, Parish, Subcounty, etc)
    Verify with what in the system against what registration form have arried (in the box file) using these serial numbers.
    You can even know who's forms have not arrived.

    Take note of the time we have, whatever we're adding shouldn't slow the system. Keep within scope and scale

    We need to find a way to acknowledge receipt of the registration forms.
    Is there a way of determining the average rate of entry of data per form (it will take this much time to capture this data) _ being able to estimate the time it takes to capture the data.
    Have an exercise to establish how much time to capture the data ( say 10 guys capture 5 forms each and we use it to estimate) Experimental way to establish this could suffice the rate of data capture (average time) - Douglous Onyango to design the activity

    Error rate - is by entrant - a potential cause for loss of time
    Data entrants with high error propagation are to be replaced.
    Given comming workload, one can estimate the time to capture the entire dataset

    All entered forms must be returned and archived to ensure no mix up.

    There should be somebody dispatching the workload - it is signed for and once it is taken and worked on as well
